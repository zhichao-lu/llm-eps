Below are two {func_name} functions for {problem_desc}
{func_desc}

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]
{worse_code}

[Better code]
{better_code}

Please infer the problem settings by comparing two code versions and give hints for designing better heuristics. You may give hints about how edge and node attributes correlate with the black-box objective value. Use less than 50 words.
