Below are two {func_name} functions for {problem_desc}
{func_desc}

You are provided with two code versions below, where the second version performs better than the first one.

[Worse code]
{worse_code}

[Better code]
{better_code}

You respond with some hints for designing better heuristics, based on the two code versions and using less than 20 words.
