The `heuristics` function takes as input a matrix of edge attributes (shape: n by n) and a vector of node attributes (shape: n). A special node is indexed by 0. `heuristics` returns prior indicators of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input matrix of edge attributes.
