Task: Solving Multiple Knapsack Problems (MKP) through stochastic solution sampling based on "heuristics". MKP involves selecting a subset of items to maximize the total prize collected, subject to multi-dimensional maximum weight constraints.

I have 2 algorithms for this task.
The first algorithm and the corresponding code are:
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc1}
<Code>: {alg_code1}
The second algorithm and the corresponding code are:
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc2}
<Code>: {alg_code2}

Please help me create a new algorithm that is motivated by the given algorithms. Please provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The code function must be named 'heuristics', take inputs of "prize" and "weight", and return "heuristics".

Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
