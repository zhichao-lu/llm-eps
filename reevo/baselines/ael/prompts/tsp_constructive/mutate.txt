Task: Given a set of nodes with their coordinates, you need to find the shortest route that visits each node once and returns to the starting node. The task can be solved step-by-step by starting from the current node and iteratively choosing the next node. 

I have an algorithm with its code to select the next node in each step. The algorithm and the corresponding code are:
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc}
<Code>: {alg_code}

Please assist me in creating a modified version of the algorithm provided. Please provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The code function must called 'select_next_node' that takes inputs 'current_node', 'destination_node', 'unvisited_nodes', and 'distance_matrix', and outputs the 'next_node', where 'current_node', 'destination_node', 'next_node', and 'unvisited_nodes' are node id.

Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
