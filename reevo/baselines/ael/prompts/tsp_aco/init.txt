Task: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following "heuristics". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

You should create a totally new strategy for me. Provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The code function must be named 'heuristics', take an input 'distance_matrix', and output the 'heuristics'. The `heuristics` function takes as input a distance matrix (np.ndarray), and returns prior indicators (np.ndarray) of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input. The function should NOT involve actually visiting each node.


Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
