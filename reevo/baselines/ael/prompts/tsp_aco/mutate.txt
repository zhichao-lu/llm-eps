Task: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) via stochastic solution sampling following "heuristics". TSP requires finding the shortest path that visits all given nodes and returns to the starting node.

I have an algorithm for this task. The algorithm and the corresponding code are:
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc}
<Code>: {alg_code}

Please assist me in creating a modified version of the algorithm provided. Please provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The code function must be named 'heuristics', take an input 'distance_matrix', and output the 'heuristics'. The function should NOT involve actually visiting each node.

Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
