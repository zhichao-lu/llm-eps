Task: Solving a black-box graph combinatorial optimization problem via stochastic solution sampling following "heuristics".

I have an algorithm for this task. The algorithm and the corresponding code are:
<Algorithm description>: {alg_desc}
<Code>: {alg_code}

Please assist me in creating a modified version of the algorithm provided. Please provide a brief description of the new algorithm and its corresponding code. The `heuristics` function takes as input a matrix of edge attributes (np.ndarray) and returns prior indicators (np.ndarray) of how promising it is to include each edge in a solution. The return is of the same shape as the input matrix.

Your code description must start with ‘<start>’ and end with ‘<end>’. 
Your Python code should be formatted as a Python code string: "```python ... ```"

Be creative and do not give additional explanation.
